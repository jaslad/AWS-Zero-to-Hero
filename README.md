</div>

---

## 📖 About This Repository

**AWS Zero to Hero** is a structured, project-based learning repository designed to take you from understanding the basics of cloud computing all the way through deploying secure, scalable, and highly available architectures on Amazon Web Services.

Every section is organized into its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` covering in-depth explanations, diagrams, AWS Console walkthroughs, and hands-on labs. The content progresses logically — from foundational cloud concepts to advanced AWS networking and security.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- ✅ Explain cloud computing concepts, deployment models, and service models
- ✅ Navigate the AWS global infrastructure — Regions, AZs, and Edge Locations
- ✅ Implement fine-grained access control using IAM users, roles, policies, and Organizations
- ✅ Store, secure, and manage data at scale with Amazon S3
- ✅ Design isolated, secure cloud networks using AWS VPC
- ✅ Connect and protect VPCs using Peering, Transit Gateway, Endpoints, and DNS Firewall
